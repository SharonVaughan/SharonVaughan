I'm a programmer who enjoys technology's creativity.

Being in tech enables me to find solutions, help people, and feed my growth mind-set and continue learning.

### What am I working on?

Two projects: building an MVC framework, and a site to help builders and renovators communicate about their project.

I'm building an MVC framework to better understand the ruby family better. I've worked with Sinatra and Rails so understand pros and cons with each framework. This project allows me to dive deeper into the mechanics of how and why.

The site I'm building has come out of my own experience with renovating. Solving the _"simple"_ problem of commuication during a build project.
